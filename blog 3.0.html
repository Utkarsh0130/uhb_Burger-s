                            <p style="text-align:center;">The fast food Burger King is renowned for its advertising campaigns, sometimes controversial. The famous American brand never hesitates to be original when it comes to its advertisements. A few days ago, the firm decided to make people smile with a rather surprising idea. In Germany, Burger King will offer from May 8 next burgers dedicated to pregnant women. Amazing, right?
                                <br>Recently, Burger King also offers the FlexiWhooper. A wishing burger reconcile pro-meat and vegetarians. And when you see the composition of the burger, there is something to smile about!
                                 <br>Le FlexiWhooper indeed contains two steaks. One is a beef burger and the other is a vegetable burger. A nice publicity stunt from the brand which is the only one to offer menus for flexitarians!
                                But Burger King is always looking for original ideas.<br> Thus, since May 2, the fast food has launched its new advertising campaign. And the company appealed to a French star very popular with the public.<br> It’s Jonathan Cohen!
                                The actor of Family Business appears like this during the 30 seconds of the ad in his car. He stops at the drive-thru and places an order with a waitress. MCE TV tells you more!</p>
                                
                                <p style="text-align:center">In this commercial for Burger King, Jonathan Cohen takes over the role of Marc, the main character of the hit series The flame. He stops at the drive to ask for a Whooper. The cashier then asks him: “Yes of course, vegetarian or normal? »
                                    Stunned by this question, Marc wonders about the constitution of this vegetarian burger. “Are you making a bread sandwich?” What do you call it? A bread-bread?«
                                    But after tasting this burger, he changes his mind and says it’s very good. “It’s a flame-grilled vegetable minced soy”, The Burger King cashier then tells him.                                   
                                    <br>This is of course a little nod to the series The flame, the Canal+ parody series starring Jonathan Cohen. The program has also encountered a huge success with the public in 2020 and a sequel is about to come out.                           
                                    <br>In effect, The Torch: Raiders of Chupacabra will land on Canal+ from May 23. And the cast is still crazy. Jonathan Cohen resumes his role of Marc, just like Pierre Niney, Leila Bekthi or Géraldine Nakache. But new names come to enrich the program.<br> Thus, Kad Merad, Gérard Darmon or even Mister V will be there.
                                    After parodying the show Burning Love with The flameso it would seem that Jonathan Cohen and his team have chosen to take inspiration from shows like Koh-Lanta pour The torch. Only a few more days before finding out!
