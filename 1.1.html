                            <p style="text-align:center;">Burger King is taking the preservatives out of its food products. The King isn’t dead, but he is surviving. Pulling a surprising, global, integrated advertising campaign showing its iconic Whopper ® sandwich covered in mold.With no preservatives added to their menu, Burger King is starting a new regime in 2020.<br> For those who are friends of the King, this means you’ll be eating better than before. Food tastes way better when natural and without the colors and flavors from artificial sources; reasons these burgers will satisfy the smallest taste buds.  What is seemingly the boldest move by any restaurant anywhere is displaying the flaws of food. Burger King dares to showcase its famed Whopper ® sometime after preparation baring mold from decay. This is counterintuitive as far as getting people to eat. But with the current reputation of fast-food in America, it’s good to know that one restaurant is changing its attitude about their cuisine.<br>  We now can identify that Burger King is selling real food that breaks down over time, something that has been tested in other fast-foods, showing their endurance of natural elements.  This is a refreshing take on fast-food and is something we should admire from Burger King as they want to be leaders in the ‘clean’ food market. They aren’t at every store in the states but are working on it, standardizing this production in restaurants here, as well as abroad in the European markets.<p>Are they really trying to be the “fresh” fast food brand? I thought they were “flame-broiled.” No, wait, I thought they were “king sized.” Where does the angry burger fit? The impossible burger? 
                                <p style="text-align:center">Oh my, I’m confused. Maybe this is just one more stunt Burger King does, before they do something else next month. To me, the brand idea simplifies everything, not just for the consumer but for everyone working on the brand. The dictionary definition of the word “idea” means a thought, opinion, belief, or mental impression. A brand idea must be all those things. A brand must get consumers to agree on the brand reputation and get employees who work behind the scenes of the brand to agree and deliver.<br> Let’s assume they are the same thing. What we are creating is the most significant, most prominent, and yet most succinct definition of the brand. To become a successful and beloved brand, you need a brand idea that is interesting, simple, unique, inspiring, motivating, and ownable.</p></p>
